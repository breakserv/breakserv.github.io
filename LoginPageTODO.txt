-say "hi"
-say something like "here are your events from XXX email" OR if the user is new, say "Get started here" to start the authentication/scraping proces
-display map with pins (empty if the user hasn't alllowed us to access their email)
-allow user to see a list of all events (on a separate page)
-Add, Edit, or Delete an event
-logout
-unsubscribe
-if they're new, have a dialogue above that says "start off by checking your email for events"
